# OpioidCapstone

Executive Summary
This project addresses the urgent public health crisis of rising Opioid-related deaths, aiming to inform effective strategies to combat this epidemic. The central question is "What factors are linked to Opioid-related deaths, and how can data insights guide public health interventions and policies?". I will use various datasets, including demographics, geographic locations, toxicology reports sourced from public health agencies and law enforcement databases.

Motivation
My motivation behind studying Opioid-related deaths is the urgent need to address a public health crisis. Opioid is causing a growing number of fatal overdoses. Investigating the factors contributing to these deaths is important for developing effective strategies to prevent them. By analyzing data, I aim to uncover patterns in who is affected, where it's happening, and what substances are involved.

Data Question
1.	How has the prevalence of Opioid-related overdose deaths evolved over time, and are there any significant trends or patterns?
2.	 What demographic factors, such as age, gender, and location, are associated with a higher risk of Opioid overdose?
3.	What are the primary sources and distribution channels of illicit Opioid, and how have they changed over the years?
4.	How do public perceptions and media coverage of the Opioid epidemic affect policy decisions, public awareness, and the allocation of resources for prevention and treatment?
5.	Are there geographic hotspots or clusters of Opioid -related overdose deaths, and if so, what factors contribute to their concentration in those areas?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

I'm creating a PowerPoint presentation to share my findings on the opioid crisis. I've used Excel, SQL, PowerBI, and Python to create visualizations that help uncover important insights.

My analysis reveals several key trends in the opioid crisis, such as where it's most prevalent geographically and which demographic factors make people more vulnerable. These findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive strategies and targeted interventions to effectively address this public health issue.

To combat the crisis, it's crucial for policymakers, law enforcement, healthcare providers, and community organizations to work together. To tackle the opioid crisis, we need a multi-faceted approach that includes data analysis, public awareness, and policy action. This way, we can save lives and protect our communities.

Known Issues and Challenges
I will clean the data. This will involve addressing missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring quality. I will use programming tools like Python and libraries such as pandas for this. I will initiate data requests allowing lead time to obtain necessary permissions or access. In the meantime, I will explore publicly available datasets.
